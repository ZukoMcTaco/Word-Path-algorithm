# Word-Path-algorithm
This program allows you to get the path from one 4 letter word to another by changing only one letter in that word at a time, and that word has to be a valid word




## Main algorithm

I have constructed my own implementation of a hashtable which allows me to search a given dictionary and allows me to traverse the dictionary to find a valid path from a given 4 letter word to another 4 letter word using breadth first search
